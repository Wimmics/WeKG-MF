## Update VIRTUOSO graph

1. First, you have to store the turtle file you want to add in the folder ```turtle```
2. Then, run ```virtuoso-import.sh``` 
3. Finally, you can move you turtle file in ```backup``` if you want to keep it and then delete the one in the ```turtle``` folder to avoid uploading twice the same data.
